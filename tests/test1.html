<h2 class="section">Life Cycles</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>No matter what habitat a plant or animal lives in, all plants and animals need to make new plants or they will become extinct and no longer exist on earth. The adult plant or animal needs to reproduce offspring that will grow over time into a new adult that will reproduce offspring. We call this a life cycle.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A life cycle of an organism describes the changes it goes through during a life time. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These changes can be seen and are described as developmental stages. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It is a cycle because when a new organism is made, the cycle begins again. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This is when a plant or animal produces offspring. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The cycle begins again when the new organism goes through the same stages and changes, becomes an adult and then makes offspring of their own.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><span>(This sketch needs to say IN THE ARROWS: Adult ; Offspring ; Growing &amp; maturing ; (Adult)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the life cycle of flowering plants:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In flowering plants, the cycle begins when a seed germinates. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The plant then starts to make its own food, it grows and matures and develops into a mature plant. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The plant reaches maturation when it makes flowers.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The flowers produce pollen and unfertilized seeds (these can&rsquo;t yet grow new plants). </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Insects carry the pollen from one flower to the next. This is called pollination.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The pollen fertilizes the young seeds that have started to develop in the flower. (Now the seeds can grow new plants.)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The flower can now develop into a fruit that produces fertilized seeds. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The seeds are then dispersed and start to grow in a new place. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The cycle begins again.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>{TEACHERS&rsquo; GUIDE: about 4 - 5 weeks before this activity plant some cherry tomato seeds in a large container or in a sunny spots in the school garden. They grow really easily given enough water and light and can provide the perfect example for this activity. Also the learners can eat the cherry tomatoes that are harvested! Large tomatoes will take very long to ripen but can also work here. Remember to stake the tomato plants (for a VERY simple stake you can use any sort of stick, just stick it into the ground near the plant and tie the plant&rsquo;s biggest stems to this).}</span></p>

<p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>Now let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the different developmental stages in the life cycle of a typical flowering plant</p>
<h2 class="section">Germination, growth and maturation.&nbsp;</h2>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1-Fcusru_zSG2FVag65TDrnsE4iOTX4moYTv29Ckw2-m7EZu8qPerQT3VnyBhwZtL2SamTuBILVo0nAWF8Phsq9HELAiv2c3CKY9cf15oXX5IltcaLg" alt="" width="678px;" height="478px;" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">pictures showing stages of germination&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Germination is when a small root and shoot comes out of the seed. Each seed contains a tiny plant called an embryo, waiting for the right conditions to start to grow. </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><span>Germination is when the seed begins to grow.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Generally the root starts to grow downward.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Generally the shoot (new little plant stem) starts to grow upward towards the sun. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Some seeds are covered in an outer casing or layer called a seed hull or coat to protect and nourish the embryo (new plant) inside the seed. (Have you ever had a popcorn hull stuck in your teeth?)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When the new shoot breaks through the surface the plant is then called a sprout. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Sometimes you can still see the seed coat / hull sticking to the sprout when it breaks the surface.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>During its early stages of growth, the new plant relies upon the food supplies stored with the seed until it is large enough for its leaves to begin making food through photosynthesis. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The sprout uses its new roots to absorb water and nutrients from the soil.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The first / primary</span>&nbsp;leaves are able to photosynthesize and produces sugars that provides energy to let the plant grow and develop into a seedling.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><span>A seed will only germinate when:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There is enough water.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The temperature is correct - for instance summer flowering plants need the soil to be warmer while winter flowering plants need the soil to be cooler.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The seed is in a good location such as rich, dark soil, to provide the right amount of nourishment to the plant.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The plant grows according to the amount of resources available. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The plant grows and develops into a seedling that is vulnerable to the elements. In time the seedling grows and matures into a young adult plant that is bigger and usually has more leaves, and young adult trees grow thin branches.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The young adult plant continues to mature and becomes a mature adult plant. The adult plant can reproduce using flowers that produce seeds.</span></p>
<h2 class="section">Flowers</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Flowering plants reproduce through their flowers. After fertilization the flowers produce fruits and seeds that grow into new plants. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>[CARTOON TO ASK: Did you know that a flower has male and female parts?]</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The FOUR main parts a flower all play an important role in this process.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The calyx is made up of small green leaves named sepals. These sepals protect the flower bud. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The colourful leaves are the petals and make up the corolla. The colourful petals attract insects to gather pollen. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The male part of the flower is the stamen. The stamen is made up of the thin filament and the anther. Pollen is produced in the anther. Pollen is a very fine (usually yellowish / orangy) powder that fertilizes the female ovules to make seeds.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The female part of the flower is named the pistil and consists of a sticky stigma, a style and the ovary. The ovules are found in the ovary. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The insects are collecting nectar from the flowers. Did you guess correctly?</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The plant produces nectar in its flowers to attract insects and animals like little hummingbirds, honey-eaters and fruit bats. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These animals or insects are called pollinators. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The plant needs pollinators to pollinate its flowers. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Plants attract pollinators with its nectar, but it can also use a strong scent (smell) or brightly coloured petals.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When the insects or animals collect nectar or eats the petals, or if they use the flower to hide in or to lay their eggs, the sticky pollen from the male anther sticks to their bodies. </span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>When they collect nectar from the new flower, some of the pollen will fall off onto the new flower. </span></p>

<h2 class="section">Fertilization</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Flowers have male and female parts. </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The stigma is the female part and produces the ovule.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The stamens are the male parts which produce the pollen grains. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The pollen grains are carried to the carpel by pollinators. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>After the carpel is pollinated, fertilization can occur.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These steps take place to fertilize the flower:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The pollen grain lands on the carpel of the female part of the flower.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The pollen germinates.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Each pollen grain that landed on the carpel grows a pollen tube down the style of the flower to the ovary. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The pollen moves down the style of the flower to the ovary. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The ovary is the swollen part &nbsp;of the female part of the flower that has the ovule or ovules.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The pollen fuses with the ovule. This is called fertilization.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The fertilized ovule becomes the seed. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>After fertilization the ovary starts to swell and will develop into the fruit.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The pictures below shows us how this happens.</span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fAC7X2eizQ2RpDaeRFefOKCO64dYtiAGa2vpO5R_z36OqvwEKesXUpm0SY5lUeheOCo9L_AUYu0HEq0E1t-oQc_PqlVN4xNls1zLsOIUdtqReoR8Kco" alt="" width="665px;" height="469px;" /></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><span>pictures showing pollen tube and pollen grain going down the style to fertilize the ovule</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>After fertilization: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The flower swells and enlarges, turning into fruit with the seeds inside. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The seeds are carefully protected by the skin and flesh of the fruit.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>After the fruit has ripened it can either fall off the plant and decay, or it can be eaten by animals who will further disperse the seeds. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The seeds are now ready to start the plant&rsquo;s life cycle all over again.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><span>[CARTOON TO ASK: But why does a plant make so MANY seeds every time?]</span></p>
<h2 class="section">Seed Dispersal:</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If all the seeds (or fruit with seeds) of a plant fall in exactly the same spot as the adult plant, we say that the new little plants will be </span><span>IN COMPETITION</span><span> with the adult plant for resources such as sunlight, water and soil. It is therefore important for the adult plant to spread its seeds as far as possible to ensure that the young plants will survive. We call this </span><span>seed dispersal</span><span> which allows plants to grow in different places and allows for diversity of life in different environments.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Seeds are dispersed in different ways:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>ANIMALS</span><span>: Seeds are often eaten by animals like birds, squirrels, deer and bears.</span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Plants using this type of seed dispersal typically surround their seeds with edible, nutritious fruit that animals will want to eat. Some seeds will pass through animal&rsquo;s digestive tracts who excrete the seeds in different locations (The seeds will already be in the animal&rsquo;s fertile dung or guano that will nourish the young plant after germination.)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Other seeds have little hooks, sticky mucus, spines or barbs that attach to animals&rsquo; fur for dispersal.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Other animals like squirrels bury nuts and acorns, or ants, carry the seeds into their colonies underground from where the seeds can germinate and grow.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>WIND</span><span>: The wind also disperses seeds. </span></p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Seeds that are dispersed by the wind have to be very light and often have small &lsquo;wings&rsquo; or tufts that allow them to be carried by the wind. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Think of dandelions or helicopter seeds for instance.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>WATER</span><span>: Water is another way to disperse seeds. Plants that grow near rivers or streams drop their seeds into the water that carries them to different areas. Some seeds even end up in oceans and are carried to different continents all over the earth. Coconuts for instance can travel many thousands of miles in the ocean and end up growing on deserted islands - ready for hungry ship-wrecked travelers!</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr"><span>HUMANS</span><span>:</span><span> Humans disperse seeds across large distances and use different ways to do so. Discuss possible ways of human seed dispersal with your group / class. Write at least 3 different ways for human seed dispersal in this space.</span></p>
