<p>If you think of all the things that are required for photosynthesis, can you predict what will be the best conditions for photosynthesis to occur in?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Divide the class into three groups. Each group will investigate what the optimal soil, water and light conditions are for photosynthesis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What condition for photosynthesis are you investigating:</p>

<div class="investigation-apparatus">
<p dir="ltr">{Your teacher will prepare enough bean / lentil / basil seedlings for everyone in the class to have their own.}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">A container to plant your seedling in (it should be able to hold at least 300 ml). This can be margarine or yoghurt tub, a jam or coffee tin or any other similar plastic or metal container</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">rich dark soil to place in the container and plant your seedling in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">water in a bucket to water all the different plants when necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">You need to poor 60 ml of water on the plants everytime you water any plant. That is two tablespoons. If you know anyone who feeds a baby formula, the spoons they use to measure the formula often holds 30ml. Alternatively you can borrow your mom&rsquo;s measuring spoons from home. (AND if you&rsquo;re lucky your teacher might have some spare measuring spoons in her class.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Dark cupboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Paper bags or dark black bags and a 30 cm stick or twig</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">If you are doing the soil test, you will also need:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">cotton wool or torn strips of newspaper (about 1 cm wide and 7 - 10 cm long)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">at least two different types of soil: rich dark soil, river or beach sand or clay soil</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="investigation-method">
<p dir="ltr">Soil Test:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the seeds have sprouted, remove the top layer of cotton wool.</li>
<li>Choose a type of &lsquo;soil&rsquo; to grow your seedling in - either rich dark soil, sand or clay, or you can choose to keep your seedling in newspaper cuttings or cotton wool to see what will happen.</li>
<li>If you are using newspaper cuttings or cotton wool, fill your container with this. If you chose soil, sand or clay, fill your container with that instead.</li>
<li>WRITE THE TYPE OF &lsquo;SOIL&rsquo; YOU USED ON YOUR CONTAINER.</li>
<li>Make a little hole with your thumb and plant your seeding into this. Cover the root with soil/newspaper cuttings/cotton wool and let the little stem and primary leaves stay above the ground.</li>
<li>Now place one container with cotton wool, one with rich soil and one with the sand / clay in a sunny spot. Water your seedlings regularly. Make sure the soil is moist but not soaking wet.</li>
<li>Do this for three weeks.</li>

<p dir="ltr">Water Test:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">When the seeds have sprouted, remove the top layer of cotton wool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Place the rich dark soil into your container - don&rsquo;t fill the container but leave about 2 cm space between the soil and the rim of the container.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Make a little hole with your thumb and plant your seeding into this. Cover the root with soil and let the little stem and primary leaves stay above the ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Divide your group into five smaller groups.</p>
</li>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">The first group must write on their containers: NO WATER</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">The next group must write on their containers: WATER EVERY 9/10 DAYS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Another group must write on their containers: WATER ONCE A WEEK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">A group must write on their containers: WATER EVERY 2 - 3 DAYS (keep the soil moist but not soaking wet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">The last group must write on their containers: WATER EVERYDAY</p>
</li>
</ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Make sure to water your plant exactly as your label states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Do this for three weeks.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Light Test:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">When the seeds have sprouted, remove the top layer of cotton wool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Place the rich dark soil into your container - don&rsquo;t fill the container but leave about 2 cm space between the soil and the rim of the container.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Make a little hole with your thumb and plant your seeding into this. Cover the root with soil and let the little stem and primary leaves stay above the ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Divide your group into four smaller groups.</p>
</li>
<ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">The first group must place their containers and plants into a DARK cupboard where the plant will not get any light. Write on these containers: NO LIGHT. REMEMBER to water this plant every regularly!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">One group must place their plants into a brown paper bag or a dark / black plastic bag and prop it up with a stick or twig to protect the plant. Place your plants in a shady part of the class where the sun cannot bake on it and overheat the bag.</p>
</li>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">At the start of your Natural Science lessons you need to remove the plant and if possible, place it in a sunny spot in the class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">At the end of your Natural Science lessons you need to place the plant back its shady part of the class and cover it with the bag again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Write on these containers: LIGHT ONLY DURING SCIENCE CLASS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Another group must keep their containers as far from the window as possible. Write on these containers: SHADED LIGHT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">The last group must place their plants in a sunny spot very close to the window. Write on these containers: FULL DAYLIGHT</p>
</li>
</ol>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Make sure to water your plants regularly but not to over-water or flood them. The soil should be moist but not soaking wet.</p>
